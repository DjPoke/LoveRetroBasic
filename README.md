# LoveRetroBasic
Hello, i'm DjPoke.

LoveRetroBasic is (or should become) a virtual computer programmed with LÃ¶ve/Lua.
I program it to pass the time.
It is inspired from old retro computers from the 80's and from beginning for 90's, also giving acces to a tools suite, like other fantasy consoles can give.
It includes a sprite editor, a tracker (w.i.p) and will includes a level editor and a sounds editor.

With LoveRetroBasic, you get virtual hardware sprites, bobs, palette adaptable images import, and a debug mode.
