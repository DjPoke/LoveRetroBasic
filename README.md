# LoveRetroBasic
Hello, i'm DjPoke.

LoveRetroBasic is (or should become) a virtual computer programmed with LÃ¶ve/Lua.
I program it to pass the time.
It is inspired from old retro computers from the 80's and from beginning for 90's, also giving acces to a tools suite, like other fantasy consoles can give.
It includes a sprite editor, a tracker (w.i.p) and will includes a level editor and a sounds editor.

LoveRetroBasic gives virtual hardware sprites, bobs, palette adaptable images import, and a debug mode.

Graphic Modes: 320x200 pixels, 640x400 pixels and 160x100 pixels
Palette: 64 colors
Hardware sprites: 32 (scalables)
Sprites images: 256
Bobs: 1024

This project is in work in progress. Please wait to see it finished.

Enjoy,
DjPoke
